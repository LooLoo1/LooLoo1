1. Storing data in local storage
2. Easy interaction with the site via Tab 💻
3. Changing the theme depending on the season 🔥🍁❄🍀
4. Converting the date to different formats and calculating the time before the event or its end 🕗🕞🕚
5. Easter egg with M + L displays the forecast of the next 100 dates instead of 10 as with a simple click 
   on the screen you need to click before you sell the Easter egg 
6. The level in the screen of questions will rise daily and is also stored in local events, and when they 
   open play a unique animation 💫⬆ 
   (For demonstration in the local store you can change the value to any within 999 and look at the animation)
7. Current event (n to 18 in real time)
8. Timer to wait for selected events
9. Date and time of start and end of selected events
10. Choice of events to be calculated

5. Individual calendar, which is created independently and returns the exact date for one of the items for the haircut
6. Calculation of cost and working form that sends data by mail
7. Page 404 and a beautiful download site
